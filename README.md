[View the live project here.](https://kwalesch.github.io/Project_one/index.html)

This is a website with some basic information about the Aran Islands, displayed through text, images and videos. The Aran Islands are 3 beautiful islands off the westcoast of Ireland.
The website should give users information about the Islands. Also, the website should be responsive and accessible on a range of devices, making it easy to navigate for users.

## User Experience
+ #### As a User, I want to...
Find out basic info on the Aran Islands.
Find the social media links so that I can join and interact with other Users.
Keep up to date with any news and/or events on the Islands.

### Design
+ #### Color Scheme
The 2 main colors I used on this website are white and a shade of green #086631. I chose a very simple color scheme that was representative of colors associated with Islands and nature.I also chose to keep the color scheme simple to keep everything looking uniform and clearly visible.
The colors used have passed the color contrast test which I will link [Here](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/?fcolor=FFFFFF&bcolor=086631)

 +  #### Typography
       The Roboto and Ubuntu fonts as the main fonts throughout the whole website with sans-serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Roboto is a clean font used frequently in programming, so it is both attractive and appropriate.

 +   #### Imagery
        Imagery is important. The large, background hero image is designed to be striking and catch the user's attention.It is also a picture from the actual islands as are all the other images on the website.
